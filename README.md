# FluidElements and Animation

This is the repo for the Fluid Elements and Animation course on Qt Academy.

## Getting Started

- In this repo, you will find the examples of animation elements we are exploring in each section of the course.
- Each folder represents where you will end up after following each section of the course.
- If you get stuck or encounter an issues, you can use these as references to get back up to speed and compare your progress.

## Instructions

To get started with this project, you will need to have Qt Creator installed on your computer. You can download Qt Creator from the [Qt.io website](qt.io).

Once you have Qt and Qt Creator installed, head over to [Qt Academy](academy.qt.io) and follow along to create the project template and add the assets to the project.

To run a version of the project from a specific section, navigate to the desired section folder in Qt Creator and open the `CMakeLists.txt` file. Build and run the project in Qt Creator. The application will launch and you will see the application at that current stage.

**Note:** that code examples may be slightly different from the code that appears in the videos. This is because the code in the repository has been updated to reflect developments in the course creation process and to improve the code quality. The end result is the same, but the code may be slightly different in names, comments, or structure.
